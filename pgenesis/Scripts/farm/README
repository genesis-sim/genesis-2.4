This directory contains examples of how to run parallel genesis in
embarassingly-parallel or task-farm mode.  This is the mode in which
each zone does an independent simulation controlled by parameters that
are distributed by the master at the beginning of each iteration.  At
the end of each iteration the master accumulates results and computes
whether termination has occured and if not then also a new parameter
set for each node for the next iteration.

Files have a number prepended to indicate which example they belong to.
So all files *1.g are in example 1.  Current examples are:

#1 Using barriers and synchronous rpc to coordinate masters and workers
   Each zone has one node.

#2 Master executes all actions on workers via asynchronous rpc.
   All nodes in a single zone.

#3 Master executes all actions on workers via asynchronous rpc.
   Each zone has one node.

#4 Master executes all actions on workers via asynchronous rpc.
   3 zones have 3 nodes, one has one node.
