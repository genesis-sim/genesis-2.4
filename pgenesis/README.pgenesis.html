    <H3>Preliminary PGENESIS 2.4 Release - December 9, 2014</H3>
  </CENTER>

<P>This version of PGENESIS is intended to be installed in the 'genesis-2.4'
directory along with the 'genesis' directory from the GENESIS 2.4
distribution. It replaces earlier PGENESIS 2.3 and 2.3.1 versions and contains
bug fixes, updates for new platforms, and new GENESIS 2.4 objects and commands.

<P><B>MISSING in this initial release:</B>
<P><UL>
    <LI> The chemesis library (chemlib) has not been linked in.
    <LI> The new network commands volumeconnect3, volumedelay3, and
   volumeweight3 have not yet been implemented for the remote versions
   rvolumeconnect3, etc.
      
    <LI> The documentation in pgenesis/Hyperdoc has not yet been updated.
</UL>
  
<P>
NOTE: Before installing this software, please check that you have the latest
      version by checking the GENESIS web site:
<A HREF = "http://genesis-sim.org/">http://genesis-sim.org/</A>.
<P>

      We *strongly* advise you to download the latest version if you don't
      already have it.

<H1><A NAME="section-1.">INTRODUCTION</A></H1>

<P>
PGENESIS (Parallel GENESIS) is designed to allow researchers to
run simulations faster on parallel hardware; it supports both
running simulations of large networks on multiple processors, and
running many simulations concurrently (e.g. for parameter searching).
PGENESIS will also run on a single workstation and this can be useful
for testing.

<P>
If you have a network model and want to use PGENESIS, you will have to
partition your model so that specific neurons are created on each of
the PGENESIS processes, and then connect them up using the PGENESIS
raddmsg or rvolumeconnect script functions.  Unfortunately, with
PGENESIS this is not automatic, although the process is well documented.


<P>

PGENESIS will run on almost any multiple core PC, parallel cluster, SMP,
supercomputer, or network of workstations where MPI and/or PVM is
supported, and on which serial GENESIS itself is runnable.  It is much
easier to run on a network of workstations if they have a shared file
system so that any workstation can access any file.  If this is not the
case, you will need to install PGENESIS independently on each workstation
and you will need to have a copy of the files required by your simulation
(data files, script files, etc) on each workstation, preferably in an
identically named directory path.

<H1><A NAME="section-2.">COMPATIBILITY WITH REGULAR GENESIS</A></H1>

PGENESIS 2.4 is compatible with GENESIS version 2.4, and contains a few
minor bug fixes to PGENESIS version 2.3 (mostly for the Blue Gene/L
architecture, and use of Xodus under MPI). Versions of PGENESIS older than
2.4 will not work with GENESIS 2.4.

<H1><A NAME="section-3.">HOW IT WORKS (IN A NUTSHELL)</A></H1>

<P>
PGENESIS adds a library (parlib) to an installed version of GENESIS,
creating an executable "pgenesis" that has the usual GENESIS objects and
commands, plus a "postmaster" object (post) and some other new objects and
commands.  The "postmaster" objects communicate with each other through
a standard interprocess communication library such as MPI or PVM.

<P>
For more complete information on how to use PGENESIS, see the PGENESIS
webpage: http://www.psc.edu/Packages/PGENESIS.  Dave Beeman has also
put together a mini-tutorial on installing and using PGENESIS on
multi-core PCs, which may be found in Hyperdoc/pgenesis_on_pcs_part1.html
in this distribution.

<H1><A NAME="section-4.">INSTALLING PGENESIS</A></H1>

<OL>
  <LI><B>Download, compile, and install serial GENESIS version 2.4:</B>
   If you have not obtained GENESIS already, download
   genesis-2.4-src.tar.gz from the GENESIS web site, or copy
   it from the CDROM if you have a CDROM distribution.  This is a gzipped
   tar file which can be extracted with:

<PRE>
        cat genesis-2.4-src.tar.gz | gunzip | tar -xvf -
</PRE>
<P>
   This will produce a directory genesis-2.4/genesis.  Follow the
   instructions in genesis-2.4/genesis/src/README.  Make sure that after
   doing a "make" or "make nxall" you also do a "make install" or "make
   nxinstall".

<P>
<LI> <B>Download and untar PGENESIS</B> (which you probably have already done if you
   are reading this). PGENESIS can be downloaded from the GENESIS web
   site, where you can get pgenesis-2.4-src.tar.gz.
   Extracting this, as described above, produces a genesis-2.4/pgenesis
   directory; hence it should be extracted in the same place that you
   extracted your genesis-2.4-src.tar.gz file.  It will not affect your
   existing genesis subdirectory, it will just add a pgenesis subdirectory
   next to it.  If you have already untarred it into a different place, you
   can just use "mv" to move the pgenesis subdirectory (containing this
   README) into the genesis-2.4 directory.  Henceforth we will refer to the
   genesis-2.4/pgenesis subdirectory as ~pgenesis.

<P>
<LI><B>Ensure either MPI or PVM is installed:</B>
   Most clusters or parallel systems already have an installed MPI
   implementation, so our recommendation is to use that.  (You can
   check if MPI is already there by typing "man MPI", "which mpirun",
   or looking in typical locations where community software is installed,
   e.g., /usr/lib/, /usr/local, /usr/local/packages/, /usr/share/,
   /opt, etc.)  Any MPI implementation that supports MPI version 1
   functionality should work. In particular the MPICH and LAM
   implementations are known to be compatible.  If MPI does not appear
   to be installed, ask your system administrator to install a version
   appropriate for your system.
<P>
   If, instead of MPI, you want to use an existing PVM installation,
   you should have version 3.3.4 or later.  If pvm is already on your
   PATH you can find out the version number with:

<PRE>
        echo version | pvm

</PRE>
   Make sure that your environment includes the proper settings for $PVM_ROOT
   and $PVM_ARCH, and that the PVM object libraries are in
   $PVM_ROOT/lib/$PVM_ARCH.
<P>
   If you want to install PVM, you can get the latest version, as well as
   more information about PVM from the PVM home page:
<P>
<A
HREF="http://www.epm.ornl.gov/pvm/pvm_home.html">http://www.epm.ornl.gov/pvm/pvm_home.html</A>

<P>   You do not need the root password to install PVM.  After untarring the
   distribution, you will find installation instructions in pvm3/Readme.  A
   PVM manual is is also available from the PVM home page.  A PVM distribution
   and manual is also available from the GENESIS ftp site, but it is not
   guaranteed to be the most recent version.  See the PVM document Readme.mp
   for more specific issues about running PVM on multiprocessor machines.


<P>
<LI><B>Modify the Makefile:</B>
   The Makefile.dist file in the ~pgenesis directory should be copied to
   Makefile, which should then be edited for your platform type as
   described by the comments in the Makefile.  Note that this is NOT
   ~pgenesis/src/Makefile, which should be left as is.  For PVM, you must
   set PVM_ROOT and PVM_ARCH in the Makefile, unless you have set them in
   your .cshrc as described in the PVM manual.  The default setting for
   PVM_ARCH should be correct in almost all cases.  You will have to
   uncomment one of the machine/compiler dependent options for CC, CPP,
   CFLAGS, LIBS, SYSLIBS, etc.  The GENESIS and INST_DIR macros should be
   set to, respectively, the full pathnames of the serial GENESIS
   installation and the directory in which parallel GENESIS should be
   installed (usually the PGENESIS root directory).  The PARSRC_DIR
   should be set to the full pathname of ~pgenesis.  Finally, uncomment
   the EDITED=yes assignment; the Makefile will not function until this
   is done.

<P>
<LI><B> Compile the parallel libraries and executables:</B>
   There are several Makefile targets available for compilation:

<PRE>
     'make nxinstall'      - to compile and install pgenesis without Xodus
     'make install'        - to compile and install pgenesis with Xodus
     'make extended'       - to install extended pgenesis with Xodus
     'make nxextended'     - to install extended pgenesis without Xodus
     'make env'            - to show some of the configuration settings
     'make clean'          - to remove this machine type's object files
     'make spotless'       - to remove all machine types' object files
</PRE>

<P>
   Normally, you will use the 'make install' command, which compiles and
   installs PGENESIS with Xodus.  Once the Makefile has been customized,
   execute:

<PRE>
     make install

</PRE>
   If you do not use Xodus, first make nxgenesis for serial GENESIS, and
   then execute "make nxinstall".

<P>
   If there are errors that are not ignored, then redo this command
   piping the output into a file and submit it as a bug report.

<PRE>
     make install &gt; &amp; ! make.out &amp;
     (or for the Bourne shell: make install &gt; make.out 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp; )
</PRE>

<P>
   Note that, unlike the case with serial GENESIS, "make install" or "make
   nxinstall" is used to both compile and install PGENESIS.

<P>
   The compile process can be viewed by typing:

<PRE>
                tail -f make.out        [ hit ^C to exit the tail ]

</PRE>
   Note that this is done in the pgenesis directory, NOT pgenesis/src.
   Also note that, unlike the case with serial GENESIS, 'make install'
   or 'make nxinstall' is used to both compile and install PGENESIS.

<P>
   This will create a shell script bin/pgenesis, which can be executed in
   order to start PVM and run the proper pgenesis binary file.   The pgenesis
   binary is created in bin/&lt;arch&gt;, where &lt;arch&gt; is one of the architectures
   supported by PVM (e.g. ALPHA, LINUX, SGI5, SUN4, etc.)  It will also
   create a .psimrc file that should be copied to your home directory.

<P>
If you find that you need to make changes in the Makefile that are not
described in the Makefile.dist comments, or need to make other corrections
in order to install and run pgenesis, please report them through the
genesis-sim-users mailing list.
</OL>

<H1><A NAME="section-5.">TESTING PGENESIS</A></H1>

<P>
After copying .simrc to your home directory, set your path to include
pgenesis/bin, in order to be able to execute the pgenesis script from any
directory.  For example, if the Makefile setting for PARSRC_DIR is
/usr/local/genesis2.4/pgenesis and your shell is tcsh or csh, use:

<PRE>
       set path = ($path /usr/local/genesis-2.4/pgenesis/bin)

</PRE>
If you are using bash as your shell, use

<PRE>
       PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/genesis-2.4/pgenesis/bin

</PRE>

<P>
You can do a simple test of PGENESIS by running the demo.g simulation
script in the pgenesis Scripts/orient1 directory.  After changing to this
directory, start it with "pgenesis demo.g" with PVM, or
"pgenesis -nodes 3 demo.g" with MPI.

<P>This is a 3-way parallel decomposition of the genesis orient_tut
simulation over 3 nodes.  The default is to create these nodes on a
single processor.  (Of course, to achieve any advantage of using
PGENESIS, you will want to use networked workstations or a multiple
processor machine.  Details for doing this are given in the
documentation.)

<P>
The display will be somewhat like the serial GENESIS orient_tut simulation,
and clicking on "sweep_horiz" should produce a similar pattern of activity
and plots.  A log file is created in o.out, so you will need to have write
permission in the directory that contains this simulation.

<P>
For an even simpler test, or for debugging, you can try Scripts/hello.g.


<H1><A NAME="section-6.">RUNNING PGENESIS</A></H1>

<P>
Each user should be make sure that the PATH is set to include
~pgenesis/bin, where ~pgenesis is the root of the PGENESIS installation,
i.e., the INST_DIR variable in the top level Makefile.  If the script files
you wish to use are not in your home directory, the examples directory, or
the directory in which you run parallel GENESIS, you will need to add their
directory path to the SIMPATH variable in the .simrc file you use.  By
default this is .psimrc for PGENESIS worker nodes.

<P>
You can run PGENESIS by typing "pgenesis scriptfile".

<P>
There are several available options, which may be listed by
typing "pgenesis -help".  The most commonly used of these are:
<PRE>
        -config &lt;file&gt;      where &lt;file&gt; is a file containing a list
                              of machines to be used (1 per line)
        -nox                run without Xodus
        -debug tty          create a window for each pgenesis node
        -browse             browse the documentation using netscape
</PRE>


<H1><A NAME="section-7.">FURTHER DOCUMENTATION</A></H1>

<P>
For any use of PGENESIS beyond the simple test described below, see the
documentation in the Doc and Hyperdoc directories.  You can access the HTML
documentation by pointing your browser at Hyperdoc/index.html.  The
README.mp file gives instructions for use on multiprocessor machines.
The documentation also describes the use of PGENESIS on a network of
workstations.  Please report any inaccuracies to the mailing list.

<H1><A NAME="section-8.">DEBUGGING PGENESIS SCRIPTS</A></H1>

<P>
Normally the master node sends its output to your screen and
the worker nodes send their output to the file /tmp/pvml.????
on the machine they are running on, where ???? is your uid on
that machine.  Many script bugs can be tracked down by examining
those /tmp/pvml.???? files.  Note that PVM appends to these
files on every run, until PVM is halted and restarted.  Also
note that if a worker node exits without executing "paroff",
some of its output to stdout/stderr which is buffered may
not appear in the /tmp/pvml.???? file.

<P>
Output from the workers can be redirected to a file by giving
the paron command the -output &lt;filename&gt; option.  &lt;filename&gt;
can be /dev/tty, in which case the worker output appears on
your screen mixed with the master's output.

<P>
If you are running X-Windows, you can have each worker create
its own window and send its output there by using the "-debug tty"
flag when invoking PGENESIS.  This requires that your DISPLAY
environment variable is set to "hostname:0" when you invoke
the pgenesis script.

<P>
By default PGENESIS starts the workers using -silent 3 which
minimizes the messages printed by the workers (e.g., the banner).
To see more worker status messages, give the paron command
the -silent 0 option.

<P>
Common errors include:

<PRE>
        0. User impatience leads to interruption of PGENESIS
           before it has completed the initialization of the workers.
           The timeout is set to 120 seconds, for maximum information
           about the problem, let PGENESIS timeout if it fails
           to initialize workers properly (i.e., wait!).

        1. PVM can't find the worker executable.  This is specified
           with the -executable &lt;filename&gt; option of the paron
           command, the default is "pnxgenesis".  This executable,
           or a link to it, should be in ~/pvm3/bin/$PVM_ARCH.
           A symptom of this problem is that PGENESIS reports it
           failed to spawn workers and the /tmp/pvml.??? files are
           empty apart from the header.

        2. PVM aborts worker startup due to I/O in your .cshrc
           Symptoms of this are that PGENESIS reports workers
           failed to spawn and the /tmp/pvml.??? files contain
           error messages about TTY or other strange things, and
           no GENESIS startup banner.  Modify your .cshrc as
           described in pvm-cshrc.stub.

        3. The workers can't find the script containing the paron
           command.  Symptoms of this are that PGENESIS reports
           workers failed to spawn and the /tmp/pvml.??? files
           show the GENESIS prompt with no attempt to execute
           paron, or the startup banners show that the script file
           could not be found.  Edit your ~/.psimrc and ~/.nxpsimrc
           so that SIMPATH lists the directories containing the
           scripts.

        4. Incorrect use of barriers.  Symptoms are that the master
           or some worker(s) hang and eventually timeout.  Examine
           your use of barriers.  Note that some commands contain
           implicit barriers, it is possible there is a bug in
           the source - if you suspect this mail ngoddard@psc.edu.

<H1><A NAME="section-9.">USER-EXTENDED PGENESIS</A></H1>

<P>
This section is intended for GENESIS users who have written or are using
custom GENESIS libraries written in C that need to get compiled and linked
into the GENESIS executable.  For PGENESIS libraries are constructed
just as for serial GENESIS, each in its own subdirectory in a canonical
form.  See the GENESIS documentation for descriptions of this form.  In
this section we describe how to link these libraries with PGENESIS
components to create an extended PGENESIS.

<P>
Assuming your libraries are subdirectories of a root directory I'll call
MYPGEN, these are the steps you follow to create and run extended PGENESIS.

<OL>
  <LI>Copy ~pgenesis/lib/Usermake to MYPGEN/Makefile.  Modify the Makefile for
      your platform type as described in the Makefile.  You must set PVM_ROOT
      and PVM_ARCH in the Makefile, unless you have set them in your .cshrc as
      described in the PVM manual.  The default setting for PVM_ARCH should be
      correct in almost all cases.  You will have to uncomment one of the
      machine/compiler dependent options for CC, CPP, CFLAGS, LIBS, SYSLIBS,
      etc.  The GENESIS and INST_DIR macros should be set to, respectively,
      the full pathnames of the serial GENESIS installation and the directory
      in which parallel GENESIS should be installed (usually the PGENESIS root
      directory).

  <LI>Now add the names of your libraries and their subdirectories to USERLIB
      and USERDIR and set the installation root for your extended PGENESIS
      in USERINST.  Execute

<PRE>
        'make nxextended'       to make extended PGENESIS without Xodus
        'make extended'         to make extended PGENESIS with Xodus.
</PRE>

<P>
<LI> This should create USERINST/bin and USERINST/lib containing various
      files.  The only one you need to be aware of is USERINST/bin/pgenesis.
      To run your extended PGENESIS, set your path to include USERINST/bin
      early.  Then invoke extended PGENESIS with  'pgenesis'
      just as you would for vanilla PGENESIS.
</OL>

<P>


<H1><A NAME="section-10.">SYSTEM-SPECIFIC IDIOSYNCRACIES</A></H1>

<P>
When using PVM-based PGENESIS on various SMPs:

<P>
   On symmetric multiprocessors (e.g, Solaris multiprocessor, SGI Challenge,
   DEC AXP/8k series) you may need to increase the number of shared memory
   segments and perhaps other parameters of the shared memory system to
   run PVM effectively.  For example, on Solaris multiprocessor, you need
   to add the following to /etc/system:

<PRE>
     set shmsys:shminfo_shmseg = 100
     set shmsys:shminfo_shmmni = 100
</PRE>

<P>
   On ALPHA and HP SMPs, we have found that PVM does not always release
   the shared memory segments and semaphores it uses.  Unreleased items
   can use up all available shared memory/semaphore resource.  The script
   ~pgenesis/bin/ipclean attempts to release these resources.  You can use
   the command "ipcs" to see the status of the shared memory system.  In
   extreme cases a reboot is necessary to clean it out.

<P>
When using PVM-based PGENESIS on SGI/Cray Origin 2000:

<P>
   There is a problem with PVM 3.4.beta3, PVM 3.3.11, and probably earlier
   versions, in which the pvm_trecv call consumes processor time while it
   is waiting.  The effect that this has is to cause all PGENESIS processes
   on the Origin 2000 to continuously consume cycles, even if they are waiting
   for messages to arrive from elsewhere.  So, if you have more processes than
   processors, this will cause a significant deterioration in performance.

<P>
When using PVM-based PGENESIS on DEC 8400:

<P>
   PVM appears to have problems in occasionally generating unkillable
   processes.  Machine reboot has been the only recourse at times.

<P>
On HPUX SMPs:

<P>
   On HP-UX B.10.20 on an HP 9000/879 SMP, we found that serial GENESIS
   must be compiled with bison/flex:

<PRE>
     YACC = bison -y
     PARSER = bison
     LEX = flex -l
     LEXLIB = -lfl -lPW
     LIBS = $(LEXLIB) -lm
     XINCLUDE=/usr/include/X11R6
     XLIB = /usr/lib/X11R6
</PRE>

<P>
On Blue Gene/L (BGL) machines:

<P>
   You may have to download, configure, and make flex-2.5.4 (or later).
   The LEXLIB line should be modified to point to where it resides.

<P>
   The "NETCDFOBJ = $(GENESIS)/lib/netcdflib.o \" and following line
   will probably have to be commented out since we have had trouble
   getting the netcdf package to build on BGL.

<P>
   Also remember to uncomment the "USE_MPI = 1" and following lines
   since PGENESIS needs to use MPI on BGL.
