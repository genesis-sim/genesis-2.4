<h2><big>Running PGENESIS on Lemieux</big></h2>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p>The version of PGENESIS installed on <a
 href="http://www.psc.edu/machines/tcs/lemieux.html">Lemieux</a> is
based on the GENESIS
neural simulator developed at Caltech and the PGENESIS extensions
developed at PSC, with modifications for MPI added at
SDSC/Caltech.</p>
<p>This installation has been tested on a few sample scripts, but
because of the large code base of GENESIS, it is strongly recommended
that users confirm that their simulation results agree with the
simulation results using serial GENESIS on their workstations before
doing large PGENESIS runs. Due to differences in compiler
optimization, floating-point arithmetic, etc., it is very likely that
small numeric differences (in the last two significant digits) may
occur between simulations. Large differences or other difficulties
should be reported to <a href="mailto:pgenesis@psc.edu">pgenesis@psc.edu</a>.</p>
<p>To use PGENESIS, simply modify your .cshrc, .tcshrc, or .bashrc
file to place <code>/usr/local/packages/genesis/pgenesis/bin</code> on
your PATH. A sample job for running PGENESIS in batch mode can be
found in
<code>/usr/local/packages/genesis/pgenesis/Scripts/orient2/orient2.job</code>.
You can run this example batch job (in the debug queue since it only
takes a few seconds) by typing:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <code>qsub orient2.job</code>
</p>
<p>Files for the sample job include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="orient2.job">orient2.job</a>, the job script. </li>
  <li><a href="orient2.out">orient2.out</a>, standard output and
error. </li>
  <li><a href="orient2.horiz">orient2.horiz</a> and <a
 href="orient2.vert">orient2.vert</a>, output data. </li>
</ul>
