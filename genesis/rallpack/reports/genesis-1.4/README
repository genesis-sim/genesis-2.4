This directory contains the script files for performing the
Rallpack simulations using Genesis 1.4

The vanilla, 1000 compartment simulations at 50 usec are performed by
rallpack1/cable.g
rallpack2/branch.g
rallpack3/axon.g

The files for investigating scaling properties of the simulations are :
rallpack1/scale_cable.g
rallpack2/scale_branch.g
rallpack3/scale_axon.g
In order to run these files, the commands 'rms' and 'srms' must be in your
path, and the reference files must be copied into the directory where the
simulation is being run. If these things are not done the simulations
will run anyway, but will not perform the comparisons automatically for you. 

There is an extra simulation
rallpack2/endinj.g 
which models a current injection into a terminal branch of the model.
This model is described in the README for rallpack2.

Each directory has an additional file, schedule.g
This is used to override the default setting in which the output is
generated at the end of each timestep. The reference files
assume that this is done at the beginning of each timestep.


These simulations were carried out by U.S. Bhalla at Caltech, July 1992.
